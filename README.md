### Praave

*Private transactions for your DeFi apps and beyond*

Praave aims to simplify private transactions for users on SushiSwap and beyond. With the Praave MetaMask snap, users can easily switch to a custom transaction type that enables private transactions. The integration with Railgun, a privacy middleware, enhances the privacy features of these transactions.  Ultimately, Praave aims to become a comprehensive solution for privacy interactions across all dapps.

### Current Stage

At this moment Praave is at the initial stage and the goal is to develop and implement the core rigid functionality and simplify private transactions for users on SushiSwap. 

### The long-term vision for the project

- Receive proper feedback on the MVP and improve
- Integrations with more DeFi apps and just Dapps (AAVE, DODO, â€¦.)
- Privacy mechanism will get sophisticated (time-dependent, shuffled, split transactions)
- Crosschain Integrations

In the end we want to become an absolute, simple to-go solution for every privacy interaction for all dapps
