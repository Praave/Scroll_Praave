### Praave

*Private transactions for your DeFi apps and beyond*

Praave aims to simplify private transactions for users on SushiSwap and beyond. With the Praave MetaMask snap, users can easily switch to a custom transaction type that enables private transactions. The integration with Railgun, a privacy middleware, enhances the privacy features of these transactions.  Ultimately, Praave aims to become a comprehensive solution for privacy interactions across all dapps.
